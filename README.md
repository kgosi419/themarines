## Description

group called "themarines." This application showcases the group's music, albums, 
members, and events, providing fans with an interactive experience to explore 
their artistic journey.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Docker & Docker Compose (if applicable)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Getting Started

### Using Virtual Environment (venv)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/themarines.git
   cd themarines
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary packages, including Django and any libraries for handling music data.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations**
   Set up your database schema by running the migrations.
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Run the Development Server**
   Start the Django development server.
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the application and explore The Marines' music and content.

### Using Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**
   If you havenâ€™t already done so, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/themarines.git
   cd themarines
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**
   This command builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the project directory.
   ```bash
   docker build -t themarines .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**
   Use the following command to run your container. Adjust the ports if necessary.
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 themarines
   ```

4. **Access the Application**
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port) to view the application and engage with The Marines' musical content.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all necessary files are included in the repository.
- Check for errors in the terminal output and address them accordingly.
- Make sure Docker is running before you attempt to build or run any containers.
- If you encounter database-related issues, ensure your settings are configured correctly in `settings.py`.
